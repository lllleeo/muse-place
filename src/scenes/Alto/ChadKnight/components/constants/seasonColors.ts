    "Winter is the most regal of seasons. It commands attention and takes somewhat of a cutthroat approach: only the strongest and most resourceful survive.\n" +
    "A huge element of winter is snow. Snow is highly symbolic – purity, calm, reflection.Snow is a transitional entity. It falls between water and ice, the edge of liquid and solid. It still has the fluidity of motion, but not compared to its former, unfrozen degree. Snow has an inherent softness and gentleness as it flows down from the sky but can create devastating blizzards. This mirrors human nature and all of the natural world. Like yin and yang: a duality that represents the double-folds of existence.",

    "This is a transitional time of year, when the cold and dark dwindle away and the rains of rebirth fall upon the Earth. The light begins to shine brightly once more, animals emerge once again, and plants and flowers spring into bloom. At this time of year, everything enters a state of renewal. This directly speaks to our mentality. Spring is a time for us to embark on new journeys and start new projects with fresh ideas. Spring is abundant in symbolism, with baby animals, fresh flowers, eggs as signs of fertility, rainbows, and green grass signifying the re-emergence of nature.",

Summer is a magical time for self-development. It is the season of finding yourself, of trying new things. The days are longer and the nights are warm and welcoming. In summer, we needn’t hide, hibernate, or bundle up. Life is unwritten with adventures waiting around every corner. Summer reminds us of the vitality and youthfulness present in our being. The sun represents life, influence, and strength.",

    "Falling leaves symbolize change and even though they are brilliant in color, we know soon to follow is winter. Fall brings a certain melancholy. We must prepare for an end. Our symbolic human autumn of maturity must prepare for the winter of old age and death. Because day and night are the same length on the autumnal equinox, ancient cultures associated this day with the concept of balance.",
