## Layers

layers are a reality that is a subset of a higher reality

Base Reality is described with

```jsx
<StandardEnvironment>
    {any idea}
</StandardEnvironment>
```

Base Reality, but with identity is

```jsx
<StandardEnvironment>
    <Identity>
        {ideas that exist with the identity's reality}
    </Identity>
    {any idea}
</StandardEnvironment>
```

this is basically a way to rename react contexts that fit the story
